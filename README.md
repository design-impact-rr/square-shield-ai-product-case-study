# Square Shield – AI‑Native Risk & Reliability Layer for Square Sellers

> Work sample for the Square Associate Product Manager Program (APM) – AI‑native product case study.

## 1. Overview

**Problem:** Briefly describe the core seller pain (e.g., frozen funds, chargebacks, outages, unclear risk decisions).  
**Solution:** Square Shield – a risk and reliability layer that uses AI to detect, explain, and proactively mitigate issues for sellers.  
**Who it’s for:** 1–2 target seller personas (e.g., small retail, food & beverage, service providers).  
**My role:** Product lead for discovery, scoping, and defining the MVP (research, synthesis, requirements, experience flows).

## 2. Problem & Context

- What specific problems are sellers facing today?  
- Why is this costly or risky for them and for Square?  
- How did I ground this in real signals (e.g., reviews, support stories, anecdotes)?  
- Constraints and assumptions (e.g., risk policies, regulatory constraints, existing Square systems).

## 3. Research & Insights

### 3.1 Inputs

- How many items were reviewed or analyzed.  
- Any segmentation (seller type, geography, product, etc.).

### 3.2 Key Insights

- Insight 1 – brief statement + what it implies for product direction.  
- Insight 2 – brief statement + implication.  
- Insight 3 – brief statement + implication.

- What v1 must achieve for Square (risk, operations, trust).

### 5.2 Core v1 Capabilities

1. Capability 1 – short name + 2–3 bullet details.  
2. Capability 2 – short name + details.  
3. Capability 3 – short name + details.  
4. Capability 4 – short name + details.

## 6. How AI Is Used

### 6.1 AI Use Cases

- Discovery: how AI helped cluster, summarize, or analyze seller feedback.  
- Product: where AI is in the experience (e.g., explanations, predictions, triage, recommendations).  
- Operations: how AI assists internal teams (e.g., support, risk ops, sales).

### 6.2 AI Workflows & Prompts

- Example workflow 1 – short description of the input, AI behavior, and output.  
- Example workflow 2.  

> See `/ai-playbooks/` for concrete prompt examples and flows.

### 6.3 Risks & Guardrails

- Potential failure modes or biases.  
- Guardrails and product decisions to mitigate them (e.g., human review, clear disclaimers, safe defaults).

## 7. Experience Overview

### 7.1 Key Flows

- Flow 1 – short narrative of the end‑to‑end seller journey.  
- Flow 2 – short narrative.  

### 7.2 Sample Screens / Artifacts

- Link to Figma or mockups (if available).  
- Short explanation of 2–3 critical screens or states.

---

## 8. Metrics & Success Criteria

### 8.1 Core Metrics

- Seller‑facing metrics (e.g., reduced time to resolution, fewer surprise holds).  
- Business/risk metrics (e.g., fraud loss impact, support ticket volume).

### 8.2 How I’d Measure v1

- What data I’d instrument.  
- How I’d run early experiments or pilots.  
- What “good” looks like after 3–6 months.

## 9. V2+ Roadmap

- V2 idea 1 – brief description and why it matters.  
- V2 idea 2.  
- V2 idea 3.

Optional: call out bets you’d explore if you had more time or access to internal data.

---

## 10. My Process & Learnings

- How I approached this project end‑to‑end.  
- What I’d do differently with more time or with access to internal tools/data.  
- How this reflects how I’d work as an APM at Square (collaboration, experimentation, AI‑native workflows).
